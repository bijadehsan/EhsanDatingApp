4c. verify angular project is runnig by the following command "ng serve -o" this opens a new browser and runs Angular project
4d. if you run your API project from Visual Studio, then after you refresh your browser, you will see both my name and your name on the browser
this verifies both Angular and API project are connected together

5. Downlaod Postman app from the following url: https://www.postman.com/downloads/
6. create an account and login into your account using Postman desktop application

Note:
8. go through all section 1, 2, 3.
9. For EhsanDatingApp, skip doing lecture 29, 30. We are using from Http not from Https
10. Since we are using from http, rather than https, I have updated the postman collection and pushed that into
the repository called "EhsanDatingApp.postman_collection", so you can import instead of Neil's (the teacher) postman collection described in lecture 16

11. For you own practice, create another folder in another place, and just do as the instructor is saying to create the applications (API, client) and
make them work together. But for EhsanDatingApp, please follow the above instructions
